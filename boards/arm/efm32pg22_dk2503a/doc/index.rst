EFM32PG22 Pearl Gecko Starter Kit
#############################

Overview
********

The EFM32PG22 Dev Kit EFM32PG22-DK2503A is a low cost, small form factor 
prototype and development platform for the EFM32PG22 microcontroller.

The board is a small and cost-effective, feature-rich, 
prototype and development platform based on the EFM32â„¢ microcontroller.

The PG22 Dev Kit is an ideal platform for developing energy-friendly 
electronic devices.

A built-in SEGGER J-Link debugger ensures easy debugging through the 
USB Micro-B connector. 

Most of the EFM32PG22 I/Os are routed to breakout pads on the sides 
of the board making it easy to expand on the board and evaluate the 
EFM32PG22's features with custom hardware.

Connections and IOs
===================

The EFM32PG22 SoC has four GPIO controllers (PORTA to PORTD) and
all are enabled for the EFM32PG22-DK2503A board.

In the following table, the column **Name** contains pin names. For example, PB2
means pin number 2 on PORTB, as used in the board's datasheets and manuals.

The EFM32PG22 SoC has a maximum 76.8 MHz operating frequency.

Serial Port
===========

The EFM32PG22 SoC has two USARTs and one Enhanced UART (EUART).

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. note::
   Before using the kit the first time, you should update the J-Link firmware
   from `J-Link-Downloads`_

Flashing
========

The EFM32PG22-DK2503A includes an `J-Link`_ serial and debug adaptor built into the
board. The adaptor provides:

- A USB connection to the host computer, which exposes a mass storage device and a
  USB serial port.
- A serial flash device, which implements the USB flash disk file storage.
- A physical UART connection which is relayed over interface USB serial port.

Flashing an application to EFM32PG22-DK2503A
-------------------------------------------

The sample application :ref:`hello_world` is used for this example.
Build the Zephyr kernel and application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: efm32pg22_dk2503a
   :goals: build

Connect the EFM32PG22-DK2503A to your host computer using the USB port and you
should see a USB connection which exposes a mass storage device(DK2503A).
Copy the generated zephyr.bin to the DK2503A drive.

Use a USB-to-UART converter such as an FT232/CP2102 to connect to the UART on the
expansion header.

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you'll see the following message on the corresponding serial port
terminal session:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm
